NREL-AQ-Full
============
Here is an overview of what the scripts accomplish. 
•  Create input files for the EPA’s nonroad program (NR) (allocation, population, and option static files are created in the appropriate directory )

•	Execute NR batch files to create a spatially explicit emissions inventory for each feedstock

•	Post-process the static files created by the NR batch runs and place the emissions inventory (EI) into the database

•	Create emissions from other sources: nitrification from fertilizer application, voc from pesticide applications, and fugitive dust from machinery operations. 

•	Compare EI to the national emissions inventory (NEI)

•	Create info-graphics that explain on a high level how the emissions inventory varies between counties and compares to the NEI.
